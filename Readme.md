RentEase is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack. It provides a platform for users to list their items for rent and to rent items from other users. This project demonstrates a complete user flow from registration and authentication to creating and managing rentals.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Item Listings:** Authenticated users can create, view, and delete their own rental listings.
- **Rental System:** Users can rent available items, which updates the item's status across the application.
- **Personal Dashboard:** A dedicated "My Rentals" page for users to view and manage items they have currently rented.
- **Cancel Rentals:** Users can cancel their rentals, which makes the item available again for others.
- **Protected Routes:** Backend API and frontend routes are protected to ensure only authenticated and authorized users can perform certain actions.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface built with React and styled with modern CSS.
